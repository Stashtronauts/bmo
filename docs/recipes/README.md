While at it's core BMO is a flexible suite of packages that allows a developer to customize their work flow
it was originally created to enable developers to quickly and easily write testable microservices
while minimizing boilerplate in applications.

# [Microservice](/recipes/microservice)
Using the bmo cli and http-server you can write and deploy a microservice with minimal code. bmo http server
takes care of the boilerplate code and allows you to focus on writing and maintaining the important application code.
